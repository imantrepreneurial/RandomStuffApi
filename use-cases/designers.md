# For Designers

Designers can use Random Stuff API for image manipulation!&#x20;

Tired of making the same kind of meme images every time? Well, worry not! Just use our /canvas Endpoint to utilize the functionality of our API in order to manipulate images in the way you like.

These can then be integrated into Websites/Discord Bots/Reddit Bots, and much more!
