## Features

### 1. Access to beta endpoints:

Purchasing Random Stuff Api premium allows you to access beta endpoints, beta endpoints are newly added endpoints that aren't fully ready for production and will require additional testing to point out any bugs. You will retain access to the beta endpoints even when it has entered the production phase!&#x20;

`/weather`, and `/facts` endpoints were also at one point in beta and it was later decided to add /facts as a premium endpoint

### 2. Access to premium endpoints:&#x20;

Purchasing Random Stuff Api premium also allows you to access premium endpoints, premium endpoints are those endpoints that are only accessible through the premium version and can perform amazing functions.&#x20;

**Fun Fact**&#x20;

`The /anime` endpoint was once a premium endpoint but upon mass request for that endpoint to be added under the free plan, it was changed to a free endpoint
